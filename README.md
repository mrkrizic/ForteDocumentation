Additional documentation on how to compile forte

The guides in this repository are my own and should not be used as a reference. If you are looking for the official documentation visit:

Feel free to use these, but I cannot guarantee that it will work on your computer, due to changes I cannot control. Visit the forums if you have any questions: https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&frm_id=308
